# My_Spotify_Data_Analysis
The idea behind this project is to analyze my own song-listening data from spotify and explore my music taste from an Analysts point of view.
Iâ€™ve analyzed different metrics like, top 10 songs, top 10 artists etc; and found some interesting results. For instance, the day on which I listened to maximum number of songs and the day on which I listened songs for maximum duration, are different.
I got the overall view of my music listening data and presented it with various charts to visualize it.
